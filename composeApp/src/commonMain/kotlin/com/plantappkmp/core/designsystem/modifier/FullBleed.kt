/**
 * Lets a child draw [horizontal] past each side of its parent's padding.
 *
 * A scrolling page usually wants one horizontal gutter, applied once as the
 * list's content padding — but a full-bleed band inside it (artwork that runs
 * to the screen edges, a carousel that peeks the next card) has to escape that
 * gutter without leaving the list, or the page ends up with two independent
 * scroll positions.
 *
 * The child is measured wider and shifted left; the layout still reports the
 * original width, so everything after it is placed as though nothing happened.
