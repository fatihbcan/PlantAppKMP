/**
 * Semantic colour roles for the whole app.
 *
 * Composables read these through [AppTheme.colors] and never construct a
 * [Color] themselves, so a palette change is a one-file change.
 *
 * The values are the design file's own exports rather than eyeballed
 * matches — the brand green, the inactive nav grey and the premium strip's
 * two golds in particular were all wrong when measured off screenshots.
