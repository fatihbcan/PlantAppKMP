/**
 * Drives the three intro pages and decides when the flow moves on.
 *
 * It owns no I/O: the completion flag is written by the paywall, because the
 * case ends onboarding at the paywall's close button rather than here.
 *
 * Note what this does *not* carry. The Flutter build of this screen needs an
 * `isFinished` flag in state plus a `finishConsumed` event to clear it,
 * because a Bloc has no way to navigate. Here the ViewModel holds an injected
 * [IntroNavigator], so advancing to the paywall is a call rather than a flag
 * the view has to notice and acknowledge.
